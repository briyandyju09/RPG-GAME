Game title: Gone Rogue

Main lore/idea: 

MC wakes up with random flashbacks of his life as an nightmare in an hospital bed. He's informed by the doctor that he had a bad accident and lost all his memory. The MC doesn't know anything about himself and no one can identify him. Apparently the entire world had been taken over by AI robots who aimed to wipe out the human race or bring it down as a minority. The MC has a feeling that he needs to reach the HQ of the company which caused all this. He fights himself to prepare, fights everything in his path, befriends people along the way, gets a pet, and reaches HQ. It was when he reached HQ he sees photos of himself all around the CEO office. That's when he realizes that he was always the CEO of that company and the one who caused the rouge robots. Apparently he was put into an accident on purpose by the robots and that's why they always wanted to attack him first and no one near him..

Additional ideas:

Maybe should call this monopoly company "ClosedAI" as a spinoff to openai (this company declared an AI vs man war against the united allied world and won)

I'm thinking a pet Orpheus for the mc which develops an ability to detect AI near it (mc discovers it's the same robot he built prior to the accident as an backup Incase something went wrong)

the USSR reunited too because of mass panic. and they also developed their own AI and they tried to live in paradise to experience true communism. however in the process got hacked by the MCs company leading to the fall of Moscow and 90% of USSR wiped out

game ends with the closing screen that says "You are your enemy. Confront your inner battles, for you are your own greatest enemy. Overcome yourself, and nothing can stand in your way."
